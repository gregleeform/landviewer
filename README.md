# Run and deploy your AI Studio app

This contains everything you need to run your app locally.

View your app in AI Studio: https://ai.studio/apps/drive/11PQyrPZPjrgqLpjauM5lbUagr6I_9fco

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:**  Node.js


1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` in [.env.local](.env.local) to your Gemini API key
3. Run the app:
   `npm run dev`

## Python Desktop Prototype

The `python_app/` directory contains an in-progress PySide6 port of the Landviewer app.
The current prototype reproduces the upload workflow, offers an interactive cadastral crop
workspace, and now includes both manual and guided automatic pinning tools along with the
advanced colour filter dialog so you can isolate parcel lines before aligning the overlay on
top of the field photo directly on the desktop. A line thickness slider mirrors the React
appâ€™s simple dilation effect, a unified line smoothing control now softens both the red
parcel strokes and their optional outline, and a companion outline colour/width control
adds a contrasting stroke (white by default) around the red parcels so they stay easy to
read after warping.

### Run the desktop prototype

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.10+

1. `cd python_app`
2. (Optional) create a virtual environment: `python -m venv .venv` and activate it
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Launch the app: `python main.py` *(or `python -m landviewer_desktop`)*

The window will allow you to choose the cadastral and field images, mirroring the web
application's first step while we iterate on the remaining features.
